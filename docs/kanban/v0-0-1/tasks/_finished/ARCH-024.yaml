description: |
  Create a workspace layout and scaffold the new crates so each layer
  can be worked on independently. Keep migration incremental and
  track which modules move where.

deliverables:
  - Workspace Cargo.toml with member crates
  - New crates for domain, ports, application, ui-presentation, ui-core,
    ui-terminal, ui-tui, adapter-bootstrappo
  - Incremental migration checklist and staging action

acceptance_criteria:
  - Workspace builds with at least one crate migrated
  - Crate boundaries match the ARCH-3 crate map
  - Binaries compile against new crate paths

dependencies:
  - ARCH-023
