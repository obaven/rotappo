title: 'ARCH-1B: Adapter Boundary + Port Wiring'

description: |
  Align adapters with ports so interface layers (UI/CLI) do not
  reach directly into external dependencies. Runtime/application
  code should consume ports and let adapters provide implementations.

deliverables:
  - Clarified port interfaces for runtime data sources
  - Adapter wiring consolidated under adapters/ with clear boundaries
  - UI/CLI entry points that depend on runtime + ports, not adapters

acceptance_criteria:
  - UI and CLI compile without importing adapter internals
  - Runtime uses PortSet for external data access
  - Adapter modules do not depend on UI/CLI

dependencies:
  - ARCH-002
  - ARCH-003
