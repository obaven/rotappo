title: 'ARCH-4A: Directory Layout Canon + Module Index'
type: Story
layer: 5
domain: core
component: module-layout-canon
cli_surface: []

description: |
  Define and document the canonical directory layout for lib/core and
  lib/ui, including naming rules, module boundaries, and the intended
  ownership for each folder. Highlight adapter boundaries for the
  distributed TUI and tool ports (bootstrappo today).

deliverables:
  - `docs/architecture/ARCH-4-structure.md` module map and layout rules
  - Updated architecture overview and layered maps to match the canon
  - Lightweight README or mod-level docs for top-level crates
  - Adapter boundary map for TUI and tool ports

acceptance_criteria:
  - The module map matches the actual lib/ directory structure
  - No docs reference obsolete folders or naming conventions
  - New crates have clear ownership and boundary descriptions
  - TUI adapter boundaries and tool ports are explicit

dependencies:
  - ARCH-034
