description: |
  Define ports for action status, health checks, and log streaming so the
  runtime can swap adapters without refactors. Provide in-memory and
  Bootstrappo implementations.

deliverables:
  - Port traits for action status and health reporting
  - In-memory adapter for tests and offline use
  - Bootstrappo adapter implementing the ports

acceptance_criteria:
  - Runtime depends on trait objects or generics, not concrete adapters
  - Adapters can be swapped via configuration

dependencies:
  - UI-025
  - UI-002
