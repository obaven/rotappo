  without blocking other UI updates.

  - Log panel rendering with level-based coloring
  - Search and filter controls (level, component, text)
  - Scrollback buffer with bounded memory usage

acceptance_criteria:
  - Log stream updates without freezing the UI
  - Filters apply locally without runtime restarts
  - Scrollback size is configurable and bounded

  - UI-008
