description: |
  Build an htop-style terminal UI for Bootstrappo using ratatui,
  enabling live status monitoring and action triggers from a single
  screen. This is the primary local operator experience. Implement
  the TUI in the lib/rotappo crate to keep it decoupled from the CLI.

deliverables:
  - TUI shell with layouts, keybindings, and help panel
  - Live plan and capability views with status indicators
  - Action launcher with confirmations and progress feedback
  - Streaming log panel with filtering

acceptance_criteria:
  - TUI can observe the runtime snapshot without blocking the CLI
  - TUI can trigger core actions and show progress/results
  - Terminal state is restored cleanly on exit or crash
