description: |
  Run a targeted code smell sweep to remove dead modules, reduce overly
  large functions, and standardize error handling and logging patterns.
  Include distributed-frontend concerns like backpressure, state sync,
  and long-running loop safety.

deliverables:
  - Dead code list and removal plan
  - Simplified hot paths with reduced duplication
  - Consistent error handling conventions documented
  - Backpressure and loop safety checklist for adapters
  - Updated testing checklist for cleanup verification

acceptance_criteria:
  - No TODO/HACK markers remain in active code paths
  - Duplicate helper logic is consolidated or removed
  - Testing checklist covers the cleaned code paths
  - Long-running loops have explicit budgets and exit conditions

dependencies:
  - ARCH-034
