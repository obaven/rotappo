description: |
  Remove legacy panel renderers, hover paths, and state fields that
  are no longer used by the nav-based TUI views. Keep only the panel
  logic that is exercised by current render paths.

deliverables:
  - Delete unused panel modules and their exports
  - Remove hover/scroll logic tied to removed panels
  - Prune UiState fields and PanelId variants no longer referenced
  - Remove macros/helpers used only by deleted panels

acceptance_criteria:
  - Active nav views render without regressions
  - Input/hover logic only references live panel areas
  - No unused panel modules remain in rotappo-ui-tui

dependencies:
  - UI-004
