title: 'Phenome Runtime Action Router + Safety Gate'

description: |
  Implement an action router that executes core operations and exposes
  structured results. Add safety gates for destructive actions and
  standardize dry-run handling across surfaces. The router lives in
  lib/phenome with adapters for Primer and Rotato.

deliverables:
  - Action enum covering reconcile, validate, visualize, rotate, nuke
  - Dispatcher that reuses existing CLI command handlers
  - Safety gate requiring explicit confirmation or guard flags
  - Structured ActionResult with error classification
  - Primer and Rotato adapter modules

acceptance_criteria:
  - UI action triggers map to the same code paths as the CLI
  - Destructive actions require explicit confirmations
  - Action results include status, timing, and error category

dependencies:
  - UI-002
