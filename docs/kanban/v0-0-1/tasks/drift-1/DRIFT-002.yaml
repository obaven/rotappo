description: |
  Add the status, diff, and explain commands to the primer CLI
  surface in phenome. Wire clap parsing, help text, and dispatch to
  adapter controllers that implement the Meta-17 behavior.

deliverables:
  - New clap subcommands and help text for status/diff/explain
  - Dispatch wiring from CLI to adapter controllers
  - Basic error handling + exit codes for missing modules

acceptance_criteria:
  - `phenome status --help` shows command usage and flags
  - `phenome diff --help` shows command usage and flags
  - `phenome explain <module>` fails with a clear error if missing
  - Commands route to adapter logic without panics

dependencies:
  - DRIFT-001
