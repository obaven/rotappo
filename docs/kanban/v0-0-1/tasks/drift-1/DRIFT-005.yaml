title: 'Assembly Validation + Capability Diff Pipeline'
type: Story
layer: 5
domain: core
component: rotappo-adapter-bootstrappo
cli_surface:
  - bootstrappo [status|diff]

description: |
  Build the status/diff data pipeline using the Meta-17 assembly and
  validation APIs. Load BootstrapConfig, build the Assembly via
  AssemblyBuilder, run validation diagnostics, and scan the cluster for
  satisfied checks to compute capability signals and diffs.

deliverables:
  - AssemblyBuilder-based action construction
  - ValidationReport surfaced in status output
  - CapabilityScanner + ClusterCache for check evaluation
  - Diff computation between enabled modules and observed signals

acceptance_criteria:
  - status shows validation warnings/errors when present
  - status lists satisfied checks and observed signals
  - diff lists missing signals and unmet checks
  - pipeline works with config overrides from CLI

dependencies:
  - DRIFT-001
