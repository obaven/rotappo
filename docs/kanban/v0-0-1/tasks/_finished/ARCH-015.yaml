description: |
  Audit the interface layer for CLI- and ratatui-specific dependencies.
  Produce an inventory that clearly marks which modules are UI-core,
  which are ratatui-specific, and which are CLI-specific.

deliverables:
  - Inventory document of interface modules and dependencies
  - Classification table (ui-core vs ratatui vs cli)
  - Proposed module boundaries for the refactor
  - Audit document at docs/architecture/ARCH-2-interface-audit.md

acceptance_criteria:
  - Every interface module is classified with a dependency scope
  - CLI-specific code is identified for isolation
  - Ratatui dependencies are isolated to adapter candidates

dependencies:
  - ARCH-014
