description: |
  Strengthen architecture documentation by adding ADRs, clarifying
  module responsibilities, and ensuring runbooks and interfaces docs
  align with the canonical structure. Fold in distributed TUI system
  design decisions for multi-tool adapters.

deliverables:
  - ADR template + initial decisions recorded
  - Module responsibility docs for core and UI layers
  - Distributed TUI design doc linked from architecture index
  - Updated runbooks and interface docs reflecting the new layout

acceptance_criteria:
  - ADRs capture the rationale behind structural changes
  - Documentation matches the on-disk module layout
  - Key runbooks point to the correct entrypoints and modules
  - TUI adapter system design decisions are traceable in ADRs
