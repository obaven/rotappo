title: 'ARCH-2D: CLI-Specific UI Helpers Isolation'
type: Task
layer: 5
domain: core
component: interface-cli-ui
cli_surface: []

description: |
  Isolate any CLI-specific helpers or behaviors used by the TUI into a
  dedicated abstraction so other UI surfaces are not required to adopt
  CLI-driven models or formatting conventions.

deliverables:
  - CLI-specific UI helper module (if applicable)
  - Explicit interface boundary between CLI helpers and ui-core
  - Documentation of CLI-only UI behaviors

acceptance_criteria:
  - UI-core has no references to CLI output or flags
  - CLI-specific helpers are optional and adapter-scoped
  - Web/Desktop UI layers can ignore CLI-only helpers

dependencies:
  - ARCH-016
