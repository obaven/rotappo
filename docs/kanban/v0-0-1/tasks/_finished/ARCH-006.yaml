  Define a staged migration plan for the refactor. Update call sites

deliverables:
  - Staged move plan with ordering and checkpoints
  - Call-site update checklist for moved modules
  - Rollback strategy if a stage introduces regressions
  - Documentation at docs/architecture/ARCH-1B-migration-plan.md

acceptance_criteria:
  - Each stage compiles independently
  - Public API changes are explicit and documented
  - CLI and TUI continue to run after each stage
  - No compatibility shims remain after migration

dependencies:
  - ARCH-002
  - ARCH-003
