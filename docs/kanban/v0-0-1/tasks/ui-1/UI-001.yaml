title: 'UI-1: Rotappo Multi-Surface UX Platform'
type: Epic
layer: 5
domain: core
component: rotappo-platform
cli_surface:
  - rotappo ui
  - rotappo server
  - bootstrappo assembly validate
  - bootstrappo reconcile

description: |
  Deliver a unified UX across CLI, terminal UI, web dashboard, and desktop
  app by introducing a shared action/runtime model, consistent state
  snapshots, and standard safety controls. This is packaged as Rotappo,
  an independent UI toolkit/app that plugs into Bootstrappo and the
  Rotato GitOps app at /home/jdean/gitops/apps/security/rotato.

deliverables:
  - Rotappo crate under lib/rotappo with shared UI runtime
  - Bootstrappo + Rotato adapters to surface actions and state
  - Terminal UI surface for local operations and monitoring
  - Web UI surface for remote dashboards and collaboration
  - Cross-platform desktop app packaging and distribution action
  - CLI parity and action registry alignment across surfaces

acceptance_criteria:
  - All surfaces can execute core actions (reconcile, validate, rotate, nuke)
  - State and logs are consistent across CLI, TUI, and web views
  - Destructive actions require explicit confirmation or permissions
  - UI surfaces remain optional; CLI workflows continue to work unchanged
  - Rotappo can run independently while integrating Bootstrappo state
