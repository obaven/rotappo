title: 'ARCH-2C: Ratatui Adapter Extraction'
type: Story
layer: 5
domain: core
component: interface-tui-adapter
cli_surface:
  - tui

description: |
  Move ratatui-specific rendering, layout, and terminal wiring behind
  a dedicated adapter module so it can implement the ui-core contracts
  without being required by other UI surfaces.

deliverables:
  - Ratatui adapter module at interfaces/tui
  - TUI entry point wired to the adapter
  - Clear boundary between ui-core and ratatui layers
  - Architecture doc at docs/architecture/ARCH-2-tui-adapter.md

acceptance_criteria:
  - Ratatui types are confined to the adapter module
  - TUI continues to run via tui binary
  - UI-core is ratatui-free

dependencies:
  - ARCH-016
