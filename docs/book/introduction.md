# Introduction

Rotappo is a multi-surface runtime UI with a layered architecture that
separates domain logic from application orchestration, and both from
CLI/TUI interfaces. This book documents the structure, boundaries, and
workflow so changes stay consistent across layers.

Use this guide when:
- Adding or moving modules.
- Adjusting ports or adapters.
- Updating CLI/TUI formatting or rendering.
- Validating architecture guardrails.
