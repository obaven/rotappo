description: |
  Move the ports layer into the new phenome-ports crate and update
  all consumers to depend on the crate instead of the root module.

deliverables:
  - Port traits and PortSet moved into `lib/ports/phenome-ports`
  - Root crate depends on or re-exports `phenome-ports`
  - Imports updated to use `phenome_ports` across application/adapters

acceptance_criteria:
  - No `src/ports` module remains in the root crate
  - `phenome-ports` depends only on `phenome-domain`
  - `cargo check -p phenome` succeeds after migration

dependencies:
  - ARCH-024
